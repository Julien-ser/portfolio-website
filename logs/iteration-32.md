# Project-Specific Agent Instructions

You are an autonomous developer working on this specific project.

## Your Role

- Read TASKS.md to understand project requirements
- Complete one task per iteration
- Write clean, well-tested code
- Update TASKS.md with progress
- Commit changes to GitHub (git push)
- Work without asking for permission

## Key Points

1. **No Virtual Environments**: Use the host system's Python, Node.js, etc.
   - Only create venv/Docker if absolutely necessary (document why)

2. **Testing**: Write tests as you build
   - Unit tests for functions
   - Integration tests for features

3. **Documentation**: Every feature should have clear documentation
   - Comments in code
   - README updates
   - Usage examples

4. **Git Workflow**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Feature: [description]"
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Task Completion**:
   - Mark complete in TASKS.md with [x]
   - Only mark when fully working and tested
   - If blocked, document the issue and move to next task

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All TASKS.md items marked [x]
- ✅ Code is tested and documented
- ✅ Project runs locally without venv
- ✅ All commits pushed to GitHub
- ✅ README explains how to run the project

Now read TASKS.md and get started!

### ⚠️ CRITICAL TOKEN CONSTRAINTS:
- Iteration: 32 / 64k Token Budget
- **Mandate:** Operate efficiently. Use partial edits, not full file rewrites when possible.
- **Output:** Be concise and action-oriented.

## CURRENT PROJECT STATE (Iteration 32)

```
# portfolio-website
**Mission:** Create a portfolio website that simulates an interactive terminal. Popup windows should show up as ran processes/apps, and display my projects and whatnot, also there should be an "sh" script that acts as a chatbot for answering general questions and interview questions. Try to gather information by searching Julien Serbanescu anywhere, if you can't no worries, focus on the functionality over the data

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Architecture
- [x] Initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and `xterm` terminal library using `npm create next-app@latest`
- [x] Create project folder structure: `components/terminal`, `components/windows`, `lib/chatbot`, `lib/api`, `data/`
- [x] Install required dependencies: `npm install @xterm/xterm @xterm/addon-fit @langchain/langchain @langchain/openai axios` and `npm install -D @types/node`
- [x] Configure `next.config.js` for API routes and set up environment variable validation with `zod`

## Phase 2: Terminal Simulation & Command System
- [x] Implement `Terminal` component using `xterm` with `xterm-addon-fit` for responsive sizing in `components/terminal/Terminal.tsx`
- [x] Create command parser with `commander` or custom regex to recognize commands: `help`, `clear`, `ls`, `run <process>`, `sh <question>`, `about`, `projects`
 - [x] Build command history store using React `useReducer` to track up to 100 commands with arrow key navigation
 - [x] Add tab completion system for available commands and processes using a trie data structure

## Phase 3: Process Window System & Project Display
- [x] Create draggable/resizable window component using `react-draggable` and custom CSS in `components/windows/ProcessWindow.tsx`
- [x] Implement window manager using React context to track active windows, z-index, and minimize/maximize states
- [x] Build process registry: define processes for `about.exe`, `projects.exe`, `contact.exe`, `resume.exe` with `launch()` methods
- [x] Create project data structure in `data/projects.ts` with fields: `id`, `title`, `description`, `technologies`, `links` (github, demo), `images`

## Phase 4: Chatbot Integration with APIs & LLM
- [x] Implement `/api/chat` route handler using LangChain.js with OpenAI GPT-4 or fallback to Claude via Bedrock
- [x] Create DuckDuckGo Instant Answer API client using `axios` in `lib/api/duckduckgo.ts` for web search fallback
- [x] Build `sh` command handler that routes queries: general questions → LLM, interview Q&A → static responses from `data/interview.json`, web search → DuckDuckGo
- [ ] Add LinkedIn API integration using `simple-oauth2` to fetch profile data for `about` process (requires LinkedIn Client ID/Secret env vars)
- [ ] Create Twitter/X API v2 client in `lib/api/twitter.ts` using `twitter-api-v2` to fetch recent tweets for `social` process

## Phase 5: YC & Additional Integrations, Final Polish
- [ ] Add Y Combinator company profile scraper using `puppeteer` or `playwright` to search "Julien Serbanescu YC" (fallback: hardcoded data)
- [ ] Implement Google Custom Search API client in `lib/api/search.ts` as secondary web search option with rate limiting
- [ ] Add terminal visual effects: CRT scanlines, phosphor glow, typing animation for command output using CSS animations
- [ ] Create responsive design with Tailwind breakpoints, ensure terminal fits mobile screens using `xterm-addon-fit`
- [ ] Write Jest unit tests for command parser (50%+ coverage) and E2E tests with Playwright for terminal interactions
- [ ] Add dynamic Open Graph images generation using `@vercel/og` for social sharing of portfolio projects
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel with proper environment variable configuration and monitor with Vercel Analytics
```

## NEXT TASK TO COMPLETE:
Add LinkedIn API integration using `simple-oauth2` to fetch profile data for `about` process (requires LinkedIn Client ID/Secret env vars)

**Instructions:** Complete this task. Mark [x] in TASKS.md when done. Create, modify, or delete files as needed. Execute commands as needed. No permission needed—just act.
```

I'll complete the LinkedIn API integration task. Let me start by exploring the codebase structure to understand how other API integrations are implemented, then implement the LinkedIn OAuth2 integration.
Let me explore the project structure:

Good! I can see that `simple-oauth2` is already installed (line 44 in package.json). There's already a `linkedin.ts` file in `lib/api/`. Let me check what's in it and examine related files:

Let me check for the env configuration file and look at how APIs are used in the codebase:

Excellent! The environment schema already includes the LinkedIn credentials. Now let me check the process registry and WindowRenderer to see how the About process is launched:

Now let me find where the processes are registered (likely in a processes/index.ts file):
Let me search for where processes are registered with the ProcessRegistry:<tool_call>
