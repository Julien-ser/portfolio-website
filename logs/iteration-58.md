# Project-Specific Agent Instructions

You are an autonomous developer working on this specific project.

## Your Role

- Read TASKS.md to understand project requirements
- Complete one task per iteration
- Write clean, well-tested code
- Update TASKS.md with progress
- Commit changes to GitHub (git push)
- Work without asking for permission

## Key Points

1. **No Virtual Environments**: Use the host system's Python, Node.js, etc.
   - Only create venv/Docker if absolutely necessary (document why)

2. **Testing**: Write tests as you build
   - Unit tests for functions
   - Integration tests for features

3. **Documentation**: Every feature should have clear documentation
   - Comments in code
   - README updates
   - Usage examples

4. **Git Workflow**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Feature: [description]"
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Task Completion**:
   - Mark complete in TASKS.md with [x]
   - Only mark when fully working and tested
   - If blocked, document the issue and move to next task

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All TASKS.md items marked [x]
- ✅ Code is tested and documented
- ✅ Project runs locally without venv
- ✅ All commits pushed to GitHub
- ✅ README explains how to run the project

Now read TASKS.md and get started!

### ⚠️ CRITICAL TOKEN CONSTRAINTS:
- Iteration: 58 / 64k Token Budget
- **Mandate:** Operate efficiently. Use partial edits, not full file rewrites when possible.
- **Output:** Be concise and action-oriented.

## CURRENT PROJECT STATE (Iteration 58)

```
# portfolio-website
**Mission:** Create a portfolio website that simulates an interactive terminal. Popup windows should show up as ran processes/apps, and display my projects and whatnot, also there should be an "sh" script that acts as a chatbot for answering general questions and interview questions. Try to gather information by searching Julien Serbanescu anywhere, if you can't no worries, focus on the functionality over the data

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Architecture
- [x] Initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and `xterm` terminal library using `npm create next-app@latest`
- [x] Create project folder structure: `components/terminal`, `components/windows`, `lib/chatbot`, `lib/api`, `data/`
- [x] Install required dependencies: `npm install @xterm/xterm @xterm/addon-fit @langchain/langchain @langchain/openai axios` and `npm install -D @types/node`
- [x] Configure `next.config.js` for API routes and set up environment variable validation with `zod`

## Phase 2: Terminal Simulation & Command System
- [x] Implement `Terminal` component using `xterm` with `xterm-addon-fit` for responsive sizing in `components/terminal/Terminal.tsx`
- [x] Create command parser with `commander` or custom regex to recognize commands: `help`, `clear`, `ls`, `run <process>`, `sh <question>`, `about`, `projects`
 - [x] Build command history store using React `useReducer` to track up to 100 commands with arrow key navigation
 - [x] Add tab completion system for available commands and processes using a trie data structure

## Phase 3: Process Window System & Project Display
- [x] Create draggable/resizable window component using `react-draggable` and custom CSS in `components/windows/ProcessWindow.tsx`
- [x] Implement window manager using React context to track active windows, z-index, and minimize/maximize states
- [x] Build process registry: define processes for `about.exe`, `projects.exe`, `contact.exe`, `resume.exe` with `launch()` methods
- [x] Create project data structure in `data/projects.ts` with fields: `id`, `title`, `description`, `technologies`, `links` (github, demo), `images`

## Phase 4: Chatbot Integration with APIs & LLM
- [x] Implement `/api/chat` route handler using LangChain.js with OpenAI GPT-4 or fallback to Claude via Bedrock
- [x] Create DuckDuckGo Instant Answer API client using `axios` in `lib/api/duckduckgo.ts` for web search fallback
- [x] Build `sh` command handler that routes queries: general questions → LLM, interview Q&A → static responses from `data/interview.json`, web search → DuckDuckGo
- [x] Add LinkedIn API integration using `simple-oauth2` to fetch profile data for `about` process with OAuth2 flow in `lib/api/linkedin.ts` and `/api/linkedin` route
- [x] Create Twitter/X API v2 client in `lib/api/twitter.ts` using `twitter-api-v2` to fetch recent tweets for `social` process

## Phase 5: YC & Additional Integrations, Final Polish
- [x] Add Y Combinator company profile scraper using `puppeteer` or `playwright` to search "Julien Serbanescu YC" (fallback: hardcoded data)
- [x] Implement Google Custom Search API client in `lib/api/search.ts` as secondary web search option with rate limiting
 - [x] Add terminal visual effects: CRT scanlines, phosphor glow, typing animation for command output using CSS animations
 - [x] Create responsive design with Tailwind breakpoints, ensure terminal fits mobile screens using `xterm-addon-fit`
 - [x] Write Jest unit tests for command parser (50%+ coverage) and E2E tests with Playwright for terminal interactions
- [x] Add dynamic Open Graph images generation using `@vercel/og` for social sharing of portfolio projects
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel with proper environment variable configuration and monitor with Vercel Analytics
```

## NEXT TASK TO COMPLETE:
Deploy to Vercel with proper environment variable configuration and monitor with Vercel Analytics

**Instructions:** Complete this task. Mark [x] in TASKS.md when done. Create, modify, or delete files as needed. Execute commands as needed. Also update README.md to match this project (name, setup instructions, current progress). No permission needed—just act.
```
